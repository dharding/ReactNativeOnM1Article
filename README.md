# Developing a React Native app on an M1 Mac without using Rosetta

So you just purchased a new M1-powered Mac and want to develop a React Native app? You probably ran into a bunch of issues setting things up the way you are used to doing. This repo is the companion to an [article I have written](https://medium.com/@davidjasonharding/developing-a-react-native-app-on-an-m1-mac-without-rosetta-29fcc7314d70) that guides you through to the process of setting up your new computer to develop a React Native app with full support for the iOS and Android simulators as well as Flipper -- all without resorting to x86/Rosetta workarounds.

This repo is a reference to check your setup against the instructions in the article and get detailed diffs of a working project each step of the way. If the article or this repo are helpful to you, please star the repo, send a [clap or two on Medium](https://medium.com/@davidjasonharding/developing-a-react-native-app-on-an-m1-mac-without-rosetta-29fcc7314d70), and comment.

Happy coding!
